     This script can build the DAY conda environment(which you only need to do once on a given working environment.) 

     There is only one argument the script takes 'BUILD'.
        - This will install conda if conda is not detected in your PATH, otherwise the detected conda install is used.
	- mamba will be installed if not found in the base environment.
	- DAY will be installed to the active conda install.


    !! You should not `conda activate DAY` directly, but follow the day CLI init process, and from there active the desired anaysis environment from which to run tools from. DAY, snakemake, and environment management should be largely out of sight out of mind.
