how do i download basespace fastqs to a s3 bucket?
ChatGPT said:
To download FASTQs from Illumina's BaseSpace to an AWS S3 bucket, you have two straightforward and efficient options:

Option A: Use the BaseSpace CLI (Command-Line Interface).

Option B: Download locally and then use the AWS CLI to push data to S3.

Option A is typically preferred for large datasets due to efficiency and automation.

‚úÖ Recommended Approach: BaseSpace CLI
Step 1: Install BaseSpace CLI
# Download latest BaseSpace CLI
wget https://launch.basespace.illumina.com/CLI/latest/amd64-linux/bs -O basespace-cli

# Make executable
chmod +x basespace-cli

# Move to a directory in PATH
sudo mv basespace-cli /usr/local/bin/bs
Verify installation:

bs --version
Step 2: Authenticate with BaseSpace
bs auth
This command opens a browser window for authentication. Log in with your BaseSpace account.

A token file is stored at ~/.basespace/default.cfg.

Step 3: Identify Your Project and Files
List projects:

bs list projects
List datasets or runs within your project:

bs list datasets -p <PROJECT_ID>
# or
bs list runs -p <PROJECT_ID>
Replace <PROJECT_ID> with your actual project ID.

Step 4: Download FASTQs Directly and Stream to S3
You can stream directly from BaseSpace CLI into your S3 bucket using the AWS CLI:

bs download dataset -i <DATASET_ID> -o - \
    | aws s3 cp - s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/file.fastq.gz
Important notes:

Replace <DATASET_ID> with your dataset ID from bs list datasets.

Replace your-s3-bucket and path/to/file.fastq.gz accordingly.

This method streams directly, minimizing local disk usage.

Alternative (batch multiple files):
If you have multiple files to download, use the CLI in batch mode.

# Download entire dataset locally first
bs download dataset -i <DATASET_ID> -o ./fastqs/

# Sync the directory to your S3 bucket
aws s3 sync ./fastqs/ s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/fastqs/
üö® Tips & Considerations
Instance Size:
If doing this from an EC2 instance, choose an instance with decent network throughput (e.g., c7i.2xlarge or better) for faster transfers.

AWS CLI Configuration:
Ensure the AWS CLI is configured properly (aws configure) to access your bucket.

IAM Permissions:
The IAM role or AWS CLI credentials used must have sufficient permissions (s3:PutObject) for the target bucket.

Data Integrity Check:
Always verify the file integrity after transfer:

aws s3 ls s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/fastqs/
Optionally, compute md5 or SHA checksums if available from BaseSpace.

You said:
how do i tell from the command line what kind of instance it is
ChatGPT said:
You can easily determine your AWS EC2 instance type from the command line using the EC2 metadata service.

Here's how to quickly check:

‚úÖ Use curl with the EC2 metadata endpoint:
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type
This command will directly return your instance type (e.g., c7i.2xlarge).

üìå Additional useful metadata commands:
Instance ID:

curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
AMI ID:

curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
Availability Zone:

curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone
Full Instance Info (JSON):

curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:
If the above commands don't return results, you're probably on an instance with IMDSv2 enforced. Here's how to query metadata securely using IMDSv2:

TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type
This approach will ensure you quickly and accurately identify the instance type directly from the command line.

You said:
returns nothing

TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type
ChatGPT said:
If your command returns nothing, it likely means:

You're not on an EC2 instance.

You're running in an environment where EC2 metadata access has been explicitly disabled (e.g., container without metadata access).

You're using a service or instance type that restricts access to the metadata service (like some AWS Batch or containerized services).

üìå Check if the metadata endpoint is accessible:
Run:

curl -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
If it fails or times out, you're not on a standard EC2 or metadata is blocked.

If it shows output (like available metadata keys), the metadata service is working, but your instance may require IMDSv2 specifically.

üîé Alternative ways to identify instance type on Linux:
If you can't access the metadata endpoint, try these alternative commands directly from your Linux environment:

Method 1: Check AWS-specific DMI data (works on most EC2 Linux instances):

sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
Example output:

r7i.2xlarge
If you don't have dmidecode, install it:

sudo apt-get install dmidecode -y
or on Amazon Linux:

sudo yum install dmidecode -y
Method 2: Check via Cloud-init data (if Cloud-init is installed):

cat /var/lib/cloud/instance/user-data.txt | grep instance_type
or

sudo grep instance_type /var/lib/cloud/data/instance-data.json
Method 3: Check instance identity document (sometimes cached locally):

sudo cat /var/lib/cloud/data/instance-identity.json | grep instanceType
üö® If none of these methods work:
You might be on a container, ECS/Fargate task, AWS Lambda function, or local VM, not a direct EC2 instance.

You could verify your environment from the AWS console or aws-cli if configured.

You said:
m7i-flex.2xl
ChatGPT said:
The instance type you see‚Äîm7i-flex.2xl‚Äîis one of AWS's flexible instance types, indicating you're using Amazon EC2 Flex Instances. Specifically:

m7i: The instance belongs to the General Purpose "M7i" series.

flex: Indicates it's part of the Flexible Compute model.

2xl: The shorthand for 2xlarge size, typically providing a good balance of compute, memory, and network resources.

üõ†Ô∏è Typical specifications for m7i-flex.2xlarge instances:
vCPUs: 8

Memory (RAM): 32 GiB

Processor type: Intel Xeon Ice Lake or Sapphire Rapids (latest Intel generations)

Network bandwidth: Enhanced networking up to ~12.5 Gbps

EBS Bandwidth: Up to 10 Gbps (gp3 volumes recommended)

Flex instances are designed to offer similar performance

You said:
i have several TB of fastqs to move from basespace to my s3 bucket is this instance suffiucents
ChatGPT said:
The m7i-flex.2xlarge instance is suitable for typical compute tasks but may not be ideal for efficiently moving multiple terabytes of data from BaseSpace to S3, especially if you want to minimize total transfer time.

Here's the key reasoning and considerations:

üõë Potential bottlenecks:
When moving multiple TBs of data, your primary bottlenecks usually are:

Network bandwidth (to and from BaseSpace, and to AWS S3)

Disk throughput and temporary storage (if not streaming directly)

CPU overhead (compression/decompression or encryption overhead, though minimal here)

Your current instance (m7i-flex.2xlarge):

8 vCPUs

32 GiB RAM

Up to ~12.5 Gbps network throughput

While these specs aren't bad, the limiting factor here is the network bandwidth and possibly EBS I/O if not managed carefully.

‚úÖ Recommended Instance Types for Large Data Transfers:
If you want to transfer several TB of FASTQ data quickly and efficiently, consider upgrading to instance types optimized for network throughput:

Instance type	vCPUs	RAM	Network (Gbps)	EBS (Gbps)
m7i.4xlarge	16	64	up to 25	up to 10
c7i.4xlarge	16	32	up to 25	up to 15
r7i.4xlarge	16	128	up to 25	up to 10
m7i.8xlarge	32	128	up to 37.5	up to 15
c7i.8xlarge	32	64	up to 50	up to 20
Even temporarily spinning up a larger instance solely for the transfer can save significant time and overall costs.

‚è≥ Practical Example (Bandwidth estimation):
Suppose you have 5 TB (5,000 GB):

On your current instance (up to ~12.5 Gbps ‚âà ~1.56 GB/s theoretical maximum):

5000 GB √∑ 1.56 GB/s ‚âà ~53 mins (ideal/theoretical scenario, assuming max performance)
However, you'll typically see ~50-75% of max theoretical throughput due to network variability, BaseSpace API rate-limiting, TCP overhead, etc., realistically extending this to ~2-3 hours or more.

On a c7i.8xlarge (50 Gbps = ~6.25 GB/s) instance:

5000 GB √∑ 6.25 GB/s ‚âà ~13 mins (ideal scenario)
Even accounting for overhead, you're looking at under an hour.

üö® Important Practical Notes:
BaseSpace API Rate Limits:
Illumina can rate-limit downloads, potentially reducing overall speed below your instance's maximum bandwidth. Check their terms or experiment with parallelized downloads.

Parallelism:
Use multiple parallel downloads (by splitting the workload into smaller groups of FASTQs). You can leverage tools like GNU Parallel, bs-cli parallel downloads, or custom scripting.

Streaming to S3:
If you're directly streaming BaseSpace downloads to AWS S3 (via pipes), CPU won't be a bottleneck; it‚Äôs entirely network-limited. Ensure your AWS CLI is set to use multi-part uploads.

Use an AWS region close to BaseSpace (US-East or US-West):
Ensure your instance and S3 bucket reside in an AWS region geographically close to BaseSpace to minimize latency.

üìå Recommended Action:
For moving several TB efficiently:

‚úÖ Upgrade temporarily to at least a m7i.4xlarge, c7i.4xlarge, or better yet, a c7i.8xlarge if you want speed.

If cost-sensitive but flexible, you could temporarily spin up a larger instance just for transfer, then terminate once done.

Let me know if you want more detail or a quick AWS cost calculation!

You said:
i'm launching a c7i.8xlarge
ChatGPT said:
Good choice! The c7i.8xlarge is a powerful instance, especially ideal for handling large-scale data transfers quickly and efficiently.

Here's a quick summary and setup checklist to help you get started efficiently:

üöÄ Instance Specs: c7i.8xlarge
vCPUs: 32

RAM: 64 GiB

Network Performance: up to 50 Gbps (~6.25 GB/s)

EBS Bandwidth: up to 20 Gbps

Processor: Intel Xeon Ice Lake or Sapphire Rapids (high-performance CPU cores)

‚úÖ Recommended Steps for Your FASTQ Transfer
1. Instance Launch & Setup:
Region: Launch in the same region as your S3 bucket for minimal latency.

AMI: Use Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu 22.04 for best performance.

Storage:

Use a small (e.g., 500 GB‚Äì1 TB) GP3 or IO2 EBS volume (20,000‚Äì30,000 IOPS) as temporary scratch space.

Mount at /mnt or /data.

Example mounting commands:

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/data
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/data
2. Install Essential Tools:
sudo yum update -y 
sudo yum install -y awscli htop parallel

# Install BaseSpace CLI
wget https://launch.basespace.illumina.com/CLI/latest/amd64-linux/bs -O basespace-cli
chmod +x basespace-cli
sudo mv basespace-cli /usr/local/bin/bs

# Verify installs
bs --version
aws --version
3. Authenticate BaseSpace CLI:
bs auth
Authenticate in the browser with your Illumina account to complete this step.

4. Configure AWS CLI:
Ensure AWS CLI has access to the target bucket:

aws configure
# enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and JSON output format
Ensure IAM permissions include:

s3:PutObject

s3:ListBucket

5. Optimized FASTQ Transfer from BaseSpace to S3:
Direct streaming (ideal if supported):

bs download dataset -i <DATASET_ID> -o - \
    | aws s3 cp - s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/fastqfile.fastq.gz
Batch parallel transfer (most common and robust):

# First download locally (fast parallelized example)
bs download dataset -i <DATASET_ID> -o /mnt/data/fastqs/ --extension=fastq.gz

# Then efficiently upload in parallel to S3
aws s3 sync /mnt/data/fastqs/ s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/fastqs/ --storage-class STANDARD --no-progress --cli-read-timeout 0 --cli-connect-timeout 0
Use GNU Parallel or split data into batches to maximize throughput.

AWS CLI flags (cli-read-timeout=0) prevent timeouts on huge transfers.

6. Monitor Performance:
Network monitoring: sudo iftop or CloudWatch metrics.

CPU and RAM usage: htop

7. Verify Data Integrity:
List your FASTQ files on S3 after upload:

aws s3 ls s3://your-s3-bucket/path/to/fastqs/
8. Cost Reminder:
Don't forget to terminate the instance once the transfers are complete to avoid unnecessary costs.

üö® Quick Sanity Check Before Starting Transfer:
 AWS CLI configured (aws configure).

 IAM role/permissions set for S3 bucket.

 BaseSpace CLI authenticated (bs auth).

 Sufficient disk space provisioned.

 Instance in the correct region.

This setup should give you blazing fast transfers and make quick work of moving your multi-terabyte dataset!

Let me know if you run into any issues.

That's it! You're now ready to efficiently upload your FASTQs to S3. Let me know if you need further help.

You said:
will it help to add acceleration to the bucket i am sending to
ChatGPT said:
No‚Äîin this scenario, adding S3 Transfer Acceleration will not significantly help your upload speed.

Here's why:

üö® When Transfer Acceleration Helps:
S3 Transfer Acceleration significantly helps when:

You‚Äôre uploading data from a geographically distant location to an S3 bucket.

The network path between your source and bucket is complex or slow (high latency).

Common scenario:

Uploading from your local machine or data center far from the bucket‚Äôs AWS region.

‚úÖ Why It Won‚Äôt Help You Here:
In your current setup:

Your EC2 instance (c7i.8xlarge) is already inside AWS.

Your instance and S3 bucket are likely in the same AWS region, or should be.

Within-region transfers to S3 already utilize AWS‚Äôs internal network, optimized for speed.

Thus, enabling Transfer Acceleration (which uses AWS CloudFront‚Äôs globally distributed edge network) will add unnecessary complexity and latency, actually potentially slowing things down and incurring additional costs.

üìå Recommended Optimal Setup:
To achieve maximum performance for large transfers within AWS:

Ensure your EC2 instance and S3 bucket are in the same region.

Use S3 VPC Endpoints (Gateway endpoints) for secure, low-latency access if you‚Äôre in a private subnet.

Use parallel transfers (multiple concurrent aws s3 cp or aws s3 sync commands).

Example of parallel uploads (if needed):

aws s3 sync /mnt/data/fastqs/ s3://your-bucket/fastqs/ \
  --storage-class STANDARD \
  --no-progress \
  --cli-read-timeout 0 \
  --cli-connect-timeout 0
üß† Bottom Line:
‚úÖ Do:

Put EC2 instance and S3 bucket in the same AWS region.

Use optimized instance types (your c7i.8xlarge is excellent).

Use parallel uploads.

‚ùå Don‚Äôt:

Add S3 Transfer Acceleration for within-region EC2 ‚Üí S3 transfers.

If you need anything else clarified, let me know!

Here's a detailed, optimized workflow to quickly copy all 168 FASTQ datasets (~3GB each, ~504GB total) directly from BaseSpace to your S3 bucket (s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/NovaSeqX_WHGS_TruSeqPF_HG002-007/) using your powerful c7i.8xlarge instance:

üöÄ Step-by-step optimized approach
‚úÖ Step 1: Prepare the dataset IDs
Extract dataset IDs directly into a file to automate parallel transfer:

bs list dataset | grep fastq | awk '{print $4}' > datasets.txt
Check the content of your file:

head datasets.txt
Example output (datasets.txt):

ds.03908db673af4d7693978a78acdaa0f7
ds.40a041b5636240308c30b21cdf76af7a
ds.a92f210253354b0883c8f79be5074eb5
...
‚úÖ Step 2: Install and verify GNU Parallel
Ensure you have GNU Parallel installed (extremely helpful for parallel transfers):

Amazon Linux:

sudo yum install parallel -y
Ubuntu:

sudo apt install parallel -y
Verify install:

parallel --version
‚úÖ Step 3: Ensure AWS CLI and BaseSpace CLI setup
Make sure AWS CLI and BaseSpace CLI are authenticated and configured:

AWS CLI setup:

aws configure
BaseSpace CLI authentication:

bs auth
‚úÖ Step 4: Parallelized direct transfer pipeline
This method streams the download directly from BaseSpace into S3 without intermediate disk storage, leveraging the full 50 Gbps network capability.

Create a script called transfer_to_s3.sh:

#!/bin/bash
DATASET_ID=$1
DEST_BUCKET="s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/NovaSeqX_WHGS_TruSeqPF_HG002-007"

echo "Starting transfer for dataset ${DATASET_ID}"

bs download dataset -i "${DATASET_ID}" -o - \
  | aws s3 cp - "${DEST_BUCKET}/${DATASET_ID}.fastq.gz" \
    --storage-class STANDARD \
    --cli-read-timeout 0 \
    --cli-connect-timeout 0

echo "‚úÖ Completed transfer for dataset ${DATASET_ID}"
Make this script executable:

chmod +x transfer_to_s3.sh
‚úÖ Step 5: Start parallel transfer
Execute your transfers with parallelism set to match your powerful instance. With a c7i.8xlarge (32 vCPUs, 50Gbps network), a good initial setting is around 16 parallel transfers:

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j16 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {}
-j16: Adjust number of parallel jobs (start with 16; you can increase or decrease slightly after observing performance).

üß™ Monitor Transfer Performance
Network throughput:
Use iftop or AWS CloudWatch Network metrics.

sudo yum install iftop -y
sudo iftop
CPU usage:
Use htop to ensure resources are balanced:

sudo yum install htop -y
htop
üö® Expected Transfer Speed and Timing
Total Data: ~504GB

Network Bandwidth: up to ~6.25GB/s (50Gbps theoretical max).

Practically, due to BaseSpace throttling and API overhead, expect around 1‚Äì3 GB/s realistic throughput (still extremely fast).

Expected Completion: Roughly 10‚Äì30 minutes total.

üìå Quick Sanity Checklist
 Instance: c7i.8xlarge

 GNU Parallel installed

 AWS CLI configured

 BaseSpace CLI authenticated

 No intermediate local storage (direct streaming)

 Parallel transfers initiated with a balance (-j16 recommended start)

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Adjustments if Needed:
If throughput seems limited by BaseSpace rate limits, slightly reduce parallelism (-j8) and check if per-stream speed improves.

If throughput looks great, you might cautiously increase to -j24.

This approach is highly efficient, straightforward to manage, and utilizes your c7i.8xlarge resources optimally.

Let me know if you need anything else!

You said:
i have 32 vcpu, so is 16 too low?
ChatGPT said:
Good question! With your 32 vCPU (c7i.8xlarge) instance, setting parallelism at 16 is intentionally conservative as a starting point.

Here‚Äôs why‚Äîand how to choose the best parallelism level:

üß† How parallelism interacts with resources:
Network Bandwidth (50Gbps ‚âà 6.25GB/s)
This is usually your most significant limiting factor.

CPU (32 vCPU)
Downloading (via bs download) and uploading (via aws s3 cp) aren't highly CPU-intensive operations‚Äîmostly I/O bound.
Thus, you can comfortably utilize most vCPUs for parallel transfers.

BaseSpace API Limitations
Illumina‚Äôs BaseSpace may throttle or rate-limit downloads per connection or IP.

üìà Choosing optimal parallelism:
Since you have 32 vCPUs, you can certainly go higher than 16‚Äîbut there are diminishing returns after a certain point:

Too low parallelism ‚Üí
Underutilize resources (slower overall transfer).

Too high parallelism ‚Üí
May trigger BaseSpace API throttling, reducing per-file throughput and causing connection overhead.

The goal is to strike a balance to maximize throughput without hitting API or networking bottlenecks.

‚öñÔ∏è Recommended initial setting for your setup:
Start with -j24 (24 parallel transfers):

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j24 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {}
This gives you:

Room for slight CPU overhead for managing connections and streams.

More than sufficient parallelism to saturate network bandwidth without overwhelming BaseSpace.

üìä How to test quickly (Recommended):
Begin with 24 parallel transfers and monitor:

parallel -j24 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {} :::: datasets.txt
Monitor with:

htop    # CPU load
iftop   # Network throughput
If network throughput is stable and high (near the max ~6GB/s), leave it at 24.

If throughput is low and CPU/network aren't saturated, cautiously increase to -j28 or -j32.

If you experience intermittent throttling, API errors, or performance degradation, reduce slightly to around 16-20.

üö® Practical suggested workflow:
Start: parallel -j24

Observe: CPU and network load (htop, iftop)

Adjust: +/- parallelism based on observation

Realistically:

-j16 conservative, guaranteed safe

-j24 sweet spot for most

-j32 aggressive, may be too much for BaseSpace API

‚úÖ Bottom line recommendation:
Set parallelism initially to ~24 jobs and monitor carefully.

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j24 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {}
This approach will very likely give you optimal performance.

Let me know if you'd like assistance monitoring or tuning further!

You said:
this command was still downloading the files to my ~/- dir?
ChatGPT said:
Yes‚Äîyou're correct; the command as originally provided (bs download dataset -i <DATASET_ID> -o -) streams data, but the BaseSpace CLI sometimes handles datasets as folders of multiple FASTQ files, and it does not directly stream multiple-file datasets easily to stdout. In practice, this results in the dataset being downloaded locally into a default working directory or your home directory.

To fix this, the best practice is to explicitly download each dataset to a local temporary directory (e.g., a high-performance disk like your instance's ephemeral or EBS storage), then immediately upload it to S3, and finally remove the temporary files to conserve disk space.

Here‚Äôs a fast, robust approach that will handle the situation cleanly:

üöÄ Corrected and Optimized Parallel Workflow
Update your transfer script (transfer_to_s3.sh) to explicitly manage temp directories:

‚úÖ Step 1: Create a revised script
#!/bin/bash

DATASET_ID=$1
DEST_BUCKET="s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/NovaSeqX_WHGS_TruSeqPF_HG002-007"
TMPDIR="/mnt/data/${DATASET_ID}"

echo "üì• Downloading dataset ${DATASET_ID} to ${TMPDIR}"
mkdir -p "${TMPDIR}"

# Download dataset to local temp directory
bs download dataset -i "${DATASET_ID}" -o "${TMPDIR}"

# Upload all FASTQ files from temp dir to S3
echo "üöÄ Uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3"
aws s3 sync "${TMPDIR}" "${DEST_BUCKET}/${DATASET_ID}/" \
    --storage-class STANDARD \
    --no-progress \
    --cli-read-timeout 0 \
    --cli-connect-timeout 0

# Check for success and remove local temp dir
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Successfully uploaded ${DATASET_ID} to S3, cleaning up."
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
else
    echo "‚ùå Error uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3. Check manually!"
fi
‚úÖ Step 2: Make it executable
chmod +x transfer_to_s3.sh
‚úÖ Step 3: Re-run Parallel Transfers
Now, run parallel transfers again:

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j24 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {}
What this will do explicitly:

Each dataset downloads to its own isolated temporary directory (/mnt/data/dataset-id).

After the download finishes, the dataset uploads fully and robustly to your S3 bucket.

Once upload finishes, the temporary directory is cleaned up immediately.

üìå Ensure You Have a Good Temporary Disk Mounted
Make sure your instance‚Äôs temporary storage (high-performance EBS or instance store) is properly mounted to /mnt/data. For example, on your c7i.8xlarge:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme1n1  # if needed (CAREFUL: format only new/unused disk)
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/data
sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) /mnt/data
‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Is Necessary (Context):
BaseSpace CLI downloads FASTQ datasets into directories rather than streaming them directly as single files.

The -o - (stdout) option doesn‚Äôt work correctly for multi-file datasets or folder structures, thus defaulting to saving locally.

Explicitly managing temporary local storage and then syncing to S3 is the most reliable workflow.

‚úÖ This adjusted workflow will achieve:
Fastest transfer speeds (parallel downloads/uploads).

Minimal storage overhead (cleaning up each dataset as soon as upload completes).

Robustness (you can handle partial errors explicitly).

ChatGPT said:
To ensure that your first curl command also does not emit any status or progress output, add the -s (silent) flag:

‚úÖ Corrected Command (Silent):
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \

curl -s -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type
üìå What was happening:
Without the -s flag, curl may emit a progress bar or status messages to stderr.

The -s option silences all progress and status output.

‚öôÔ∏è Recommended practice (cleanest):
When scripting with curl, always use -s to prevent unnecessary output unless explicitly desired.

Example usage (entire snippet):

#!/bin/bash

TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type)

echo "Instance type: $INSTANCE_TYPE"
This approach ensures clean and reliable scripts.

is r7i.2xlarge ok for the fastq transfer
ChatGPT said:
Short Answer:
An r7i.2xlarge (8 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM, up to 12.5 Gbps network) can handle transferring your FASTQ files (~500GB) but will be slower than the c7i.8xlarge due to its lower network bandwidth.

üìå Key Specs Comparison:
Instance Type	vCPUs	RAM	Network Bandwidth	Suitable?
r7i.2xlarge	8	64GB	12.5 Gbps (1.56 GB/s)	‚úîÔ∏è OK, slower
c7i.8xlarge	32	64GB	50 Gbps (6.25 GB/s)	‚úÖ Optimal
üö® Practical Impact:
Transfer speed: The primary bottleneck is network bandwidth.

With 12.5 Gbps (~1.56 GB/s), transferring ~500GB will realistically take about 10-15 mins under ideal conditions but practically around 20-40 mins due to overhead.

With the c7i.8xlarge (50 Gbps) you‚Äôd likely finish within 10-15 mins total.

Parallel Transfers:

Optimal parallelism on r7i.2xlarge: ~8‚Äì12 simultaneous downloads/uploads.

Higher parallelism could cause throttling or network congestion.

‚öñÔ∏è Cost vs. Performance:
r7i.2xlarge is cheaper but slower (~2x‚Äì4x slower than c7i.8xlarge).

c7i.8xlarge offers faster completion, saving instance runtime costs.

‚úÖ Bottom line recommendation:
Use r7i.2xlarge if cost sensitivity outweighs speed.
(You'll wait a bit longer but still feasible.)

Use c7i.8xlarge (as previously planned) for optimal speed/performance.

Either instance will successfully complete your transfers. The main trade-off is speed vs. cost.

            - InstanceType: r6i.metal or m6imetal. or  r7i.48xlarge or m7i.48xlarge
ChatGPT said:
Here's a quick summary and comparison of the instance types you're considering for the FASTQ transfer, clearly highlighting their suitability for large-scale data transfer (multiple TB):

üöÄ Instance Comparison (Relevant Specs):
Instance Type	vCPUs	RAM	Network Bandwidth	Suitability for FASTQ Transfer
r6i.metal	128	1024GB	50 Gbps (~6.25GB/s)	‚úÖ Excellent (great CPU/RAM, ample bandwidth)
m6i.metal	128	2048GB	50 Gbps (~6.25GB/s)	‚úÖ Excellent (even more RAM)
r7i.48xlarge	192	1536GB	200 Gbps (~25GB/s)	üöÄ Outstanding (fastest network)
m7i.48xlarge	192	768GB	200 Gbps (~25GB/s)	üöÄ Outstanding (fastest network)
üèÜ Recommended Ranking (Performance):
#1 (Best): r7i.48xlarge or m7i.48xlarge
Reason: Massive 200 Gbps (~25GB/s) network, ideal for multi-TB transfers. If you have several TB, you'll minimize transfer time dramatically (just minutes to tens of minutes).

#2 (Great): r6i.metal or m6i.metal
Reason: Robust CPU & RAM, but limited to 50 Gbps (~6.25GB/s). Good if you need large RAM (unlikely needed for file transfer), but slower than the above two.

#3 (Sufficient, Cost-effective): c7i.8xlarge (your original choice)
Reason: 50 Gbps bandwidth (same as r6i.metal), fewer vCPUs/RAM, but still excellent for transfers. Lower cost than metal instances.

üìå Practical Transfer Time Estimations (e.g., ~5TB data):
Instance Type	Bandwidth	Ideal Transfer Time (5TB)	Practical Estimate
r7i.48xlarge	200 Gbps	~3.5 minutes	~5‚Äì10 minutes
m7i.48xlarge	200 Gbps	~3.5 minutes	~5‚Äì10 minutes
r6i.metal	50 Gbps	~14 minutes	~20‚Äì30 minutes
m6i.metal	50 Gbps	~14 minutes	~20‚Äì30 minutes
c7i.8xlarge	50 Gbps	~14 minutes	~20‚Äì30 minutes
(Ideal = theoretical maximum; Practical = accounting for overhead, BaseSpace API throttling, TCP/IP overhead.)

üí∞ Cost Considerations (typical US pricing per hour):
r7i.48xlarge/m7i.48xlarge: very expensive, best if time is more important than cost.

r6i.metal/m6i.metal: expensive but more affordable than above.

c7i.8xlarge: significantly cheaper, good balance between speed and cost.

If your main goal is maximum speed and money isn't a major limiting factor, definitely choose r7i.48xlarge or m7i.48xlarge.

If you prefer a balance of speed and cost, stick to c7i.8xlarge or the metal instances with 50Gbps bandwidth (r6i.metal/m6i.metal).

‚úÖ Final Recommendations:
Fastest Possible (cost no object):
üöÄ r7i.48xlarge or m7i.48xlarge

Balance (fast, cost-efficient):
üëç c7i.8xlarge

High RAM (rarely needed for transfers):
üõ†Ô∏è r6i.metal or m6i.metal

If speed is critical and budget allows, pick r7i.48xlarge or m7i.48xlarge. Otherwise, your original choice (c7i.8xlarge) is still very good and cost-effective.

You said:
what about c7i.48xlarge
ChatGPT said:
üöÄ c7i.48xlarge is an excellent choice for large-scale FASTQ transfers.
Here's a quick breakdown of why it might be one of your best options:

üìå Key specs of c7i.48xlarge:
Specification	Value	Notes
vCPUs	192	Very high CPU capacity

‚è≥ Expected transfer performance for 5 TB (~5000 GB):
Network bandwidth: ~25 GB/s theoretical max

Ideal transfer time: ~3.5 minutes (ideal scenario)

Practical time estimate: ~5‚Äì10 minutes (accounting for overhead and BaseSpace API limitations)

This is extremely fast, likely exceeding BaseSpace's practical transfer limitations, ensuring you maximize throughput from the source.

‚öñÔ∏è Comparison with previous candidates:
Instance	Network	Practical Transfer Time (5TB)	Cost
c7i.48xlarge ‚úÖ	200 Gbps	~5‚Äì10 mins (fastest)	Expensive (premium)
r7i.48xlarge ‚úÖ	200 Gbps	~5‚Äì10 mins (fastest)	Expensive (premium)
m7i.48xlarge ‚úÖ	200 Gbps	~5‚Äì10 mins (fastest)	Expensive (premium)
r6i.metal	50 Gbps	~20‚Äì30 mins	Moderate/high
c7i.8xlarge	50 Gbps	~20‚Äì30 mins	Moderate
r7i.2xlarge	12.5 Gbps	~40+ mins	Affordable
Conclusion:
c7i.48xlarge provides top-tier performance and is ideal if transfer speed and minimal time are your highest priorities.

‚úÖ Recommended parallelism for c7i.48xlarge:
Start with 48‚Äì64 parallel downloads/uploads to maximize bandwidth utilization.

Adjust slightly based on observed BaseSpace API throttling or network metrics.

Example optimal parallel run:

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j48 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {}
üí∞ Cost vs. Performance:
Cost: Premium hourly rate (>$7/hr typically), but you're paying for speed. With quick transfers (minutes rather than hours), total cost impact is manageable.

Performance: Practically unbeatable speed, minimizing your wait.

If minimizing transfer time is your primary goal (as is often the case with critical bioinformatics workflows), this instance type (c7i.48xlarge) is highly recommended.

üèÜ Bottom Line Recommendation:
‚úÖ If absolute maximum speed is your goal, c7i.48xlarge is an ideal choice.

ChatGPT said:
Unfortunately, BaseSpace CLI (bs) does not natively support direct streaming of multi-file FASTQ datasets to stdout, which is necessary to fully avoid local disk writes.

üìå Why this limitation exists:
The BaseSpace CLI downloads FASTQ datasets as directories of individual files, and does not package them into a single-streamable archive (like tar or zip) on-the-fly.

The stdout streaming option (-o -) works only for single-file outputs or specific BaseSpace API endpoints that produce streamable content.

Thus, with BaseSpace CLI, downloading multi-file FASTQ datasets typically requires first writing them to disk.

üöß Alternative to Fully Avoid Local Storage:
If you want to fully avoid the local file system, you can do so by using an in-memory (tmpfs) filesystem. This is practical if your datasets fit comfortably in RAM. Your c7i.48xlarge has 384GB RAM, and each dataset (~3GB per FASTQ pair) fits easily into this.

‚úÖ Fast In-Memory Solution:
Set up a RAM-backed tmpfs:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ramdisk
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=350G tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
(Adjust size accordingly, e.g., 350G is safe here.)

Modify your script to use this RAM disk:

#!/bin/bash

DATASET_ID=$1
DEST_BUCKET=$2
TMPDIR="/mnt/ramdisk/${DATASET_ID}"

echo "üì• Downloading dataset ${DATASET_ID} to ${TMPDIR}"
mkdir -p "${TMPDIR}"

# Download dataset directly to RAM
bs download dataset -i "${DATASET_ID}" -o "${TMPDIR}"

# Upload FASTQ files directly from RAM to S3
echo "üöÄ Uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3"
aws s3 sync "${TMPDIR}" "${DEST_BUCKET}/${DATASET_ID}/" \
    --storage-class STANDARD \
    --no-progress \
    --cli-read-timeout 0 \
    --cli-connect-timeout 0

# Check for success and clean up RAM disk immediately
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Successfully uploaded ${DATASET_ID} to S3, cleaning up."
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
else
    echo "‚ùå Error uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3. Check manually!"
fi
This method:

Eliminates disk I/O bottlenecks (speed is limited only by network).

Ensures no persistent local storage overhead.

Is extremely fast due to RAM-based storage.

üö® Potential Concerns and Considerations:
RAM Capacity:
Ensure each dataset comfortably fits into RAM. For your current situation (~3GB/dataset, total ~500GB data, ~384GB RAM), parallel jobs must be managed carefully:

Optimal parallelism: ~64-96 datasets (total <350GB RAM).

Avoid fully saturating RAM to leave headroom for OS and buffers.

Reliability:
RAM disks vanish if the instance reboots or crashes. Handle failures by proper scripting and monitoring.

‚ö° Example Recommended Parallel Setup (safe and performant):
Given your 384GB RAM, I'd run in batches of 64‚Äì96 parallel jobs safely:

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j64 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {} s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/NovaSeqX_WHGS_TruSeqPF_HG002-007
(Adjust parallelism as needed based on real-time RAM utilization.)

‚è±Ô∏è Realistic Performance:
Minimal latency due to zero disk access.

Practically near maximum theoretical network speed (200 Gbps ~ 25 GB/s).

This is the fastest possible

You said:
isn't /dev/shm the same thing
ChatGPT said:
Exactly right!

/dev/shm is indeed a RAM-backed filesystem provided by default on Linux distributions. It's a convenient, out-of-the-box tmpfs solution.

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison and recommendation:

‚öôÔ∏è What is /dev/shm?
Default RAM disk (tmpfs) available on virtually all Linux distros.

Typically mounted at /dev/shm.

By default, its size is set to 50% of system RAM.

Check current size with:

df -h /dev/shm
On your instance (c7i.48xlarge with 384 GB RAM), /dev/shm will be roughly 192 GB by default.

üßÆ Adjusting /dev/shm Size (Recommended)
For your workload (~500GB total, ~3GB per dataset), you might want to increase /dev/shm temporarily:

sudo mount -o remount,size=350G /dev/shm
df -h /dev/shm
This does not require a reboot.

It instantly increases your RAM disk size to your specified amount (350G in this example).

‚úÖ Modified Script (using /dev/shm):
#!/bin/bash

DATASET_ID=$1
DEST_BUCKET=$2
TMPDIR="/dev/shm/${DATASET_ID}"

echo "üì• Downloading dataset ${DATASET_ID} to ${TMPDIR}"
mkdir -p "${TMPDIR}"

bs download dataset -i "${DATASET_ID}" -o "${TMPDIR}"

echo "üöÄ Uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3"
aws s3 sync "${TMPDIR}" "${DEST_BUCKET}/${DATASET_ID}/" \
    --storage-class STANDARD \
    --no-progress \
    --cli-read-timeout 0 \
    --cli-connect-timeout 0

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Successfully uploaded ${DATASET_ID} to S3, cleaning up."
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
else
    echo "‚ùå Error uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3. Check manually!"
fi
üìå Benefits of using /dev/shm:
No additional setup (pre-existing, convenient).

Maximum possible performance (direct RAM operations).

Simple clean-up (just remove files after use).

üö® Precautions:
Ensure proper size adjustment:
Default is ~192GB for a 384GB RAM system, but you can easily extend temporarily.

Monitor memory usage carefully (use htop or free -h) while running parallel transfers.

‚ö° Quick Example Command for Parallel Transfers:
cat datasets.txt | parallel -j64 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {} s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/NovaSeqX_WHGS_TruSeqPF_HG002-007
‚úÖ Recommended Final Setup:
Use /dev/shm

Extend size to ~350GB (to safely hold multiple parallel transfers)

Run parallel transfers directly through RAM for maximum speed

sudo mount -o remount,size=350G /dev/shm
You nailed it‚Äîusing /dev/shm is indeed a simpler and equally effective approach to achieve your fastest transfers!

You said:
how do i test the speed of /dev/shm vs /fsx
ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a quick, practical approach to clearly compare the speed of your /dev/shm (RAM disk) vs. your /fsx (FSx Lustre) filesystem:

‚úÖ Step 1: Install benchmarking tools
sudo yum install -y fio
(fio is the standard Linux storage benchmarking tool.)

‚úÖ Step 2: Quick benchmarking commands
We'll test both sequential read/write and random read/write speeds to clearly compare:

üìå Benchmark /dev/shm (RAM Disk)
echo "Benchmarking /dev/shm (RAM disk)..."
fio --name=ramdisk-test --directory=/dev/shm \
    --size=50G --rw=readwrite --bs=1M --direct=1 \
    --numjobs=16 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting
üìå Benchmark /fsx (FSx Lustre)
echo "Benchmarking /fsx (FSx Lustre)..."
fio --name=fsx-test --directory=/fsx \
    --size=50G --rw=readwrite --bs=1M --direct=1 \
    --numjobs=16 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting
üß† What these flags mean:
--size=50G
Total amount of data to write/read for the benchmark.

--rw=readwrite
Tests both reads and writes sequentially.

--bs=1M
Block size, using large blocks (1M) appropriate for FASTQs.

--direct=1
Forces direct I/O (bypasses OS cache), best practice for storage benchmarking.

--numjobs=16 & --iodepth=32
Level of parallelism, which simulates your parallel transfers accurately.

üìà What to expect:
/dev/shm (RAM disk):

Typically achieves >10 GB/s (up to tens of GB/s) throughput.

Ultra-low latency, extremely fast random I/O.

/fsx (FSx Lustre):

Typically achieves between 1‚Äì5 GB/s, potentially up to ~10 GB/s for large FSx setups.

Higher latency than RAM, especially for random I/O.

üìå Interpreting Results:
The test provides clear read and write throughput values (bw) in MB/s or GB/s.

Compare throughput (higher is better) and latency (lower is better).

Example output snippet to interpret clearly:

ramdisk-test: (groupid=0, jobs=16): err= 0: pid=12345: Mon May  5 19:01:25 2025
  read: IOPS=12500, BW=12.5GiB/s (13.4GB/s)(625GiB/50000msec)
  write: IOPS=12450, BW=12.3GiB/s (13.2GB/s)(615GiB/50000msec)
‚è±Ô∏è Practical recommendation:
Run each test individually.

Note throughput values for read/write operations.

Choose storage based on highest throughput (usually RAM disk wins significantly).

üö® Cleanup after benchmarking:
Benchmark files (ramdisk-test*, fsx-test*) will remain after test.
Remove explicitly after each run:

rm -rf /dev/shm/ramdisk-test*
rm -rf /fsx/fsx-test*
Bottom Line:
You'll almost always find /dev/shm significantly faster (5-10x or more) compared to FSx Lustre for temporary file transfers.

ChatGPT said:
You got this error because RAM-backed file systems like /dev/shm (tmpfs) do not support O_DIRECT (direct I/O mode). The direct=1 option bypasses the Linux kernel's page cache, but a tmpfs filesystem is entirely in RAM and cannot use O_DIRECT.

‚úÖ Corrected fio command for RAM disks (/dev/shm):
To benchmark RAM disks, remove the --direct=1 flag:

fio --name=ramdisk-test --directory=/dev/shm \
    --size=50G --rw=readwrite --bs=1M \
    --numjobs=16 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting
This command will correctly test the RAM disk performance.

‚öñÔ∏è Use direct=1 only for FSx Lustre (/fsx):
fio --name=fsx-test --directory=/fsx \
    --size=50G --rw=readwrite --bs=1M --direct=1 \
    --numjobs=16 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting
FSx supports direct I/O, which provides accurate benchmarking results without the Linux page cache.

üìå Summary of corrected commands:
Filesystem	Command (fio)
/dev/shm (RAM)	fio --name=ramdisk-test --directory=/dev/shm --size=50G --rw=readwrite --bs=1M --numjobs=16 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting
/fsx (FSx Lustre)	fio --name=fsx-test --directory=/fsx --size=50G --rw=readwrite --bs=1M --direct=1 --numjobs=16 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting
This will fix your issue, allowing accurate benchmarking of both storage solutions.

Your benchmark results clearly show a huge performance difference:

üöÄ Benchmark Results (summary):
Filesystem	Read Bandwidth	Write Bandwidth	Performance
/fsx (Lustre)	1.2 GB/s (1196 MiB/s)	1.2 GB/s (1219 MiB/s)	‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate
/dev/shm (RAM)	17.2 GB/s (16.0 GiB/s)	17.5 GB/s (16.3 GiB/s)	üöÄ Extremely Fast
üìå Interpretation:
RAM Disk (/dev/shm) is ~14 times faster for both reads and writes compared to FSx Lustre.

FSx Lustre is fast for networked storage, but RAM disk is dramatically faster, making it ideal for temporary file handling.

‚úÖ Recommendation (clearly based on results):
Use /dev/shm for your temporary BaseSpace downloads/uploads to S3:

Massively faster I/O performance.

Completely eliminates disk performance bottlenecks.

Ideal for your FASTQ transfer scenario, especially at scale.

‚ö° Practical Configuration:
Mount /dev/shm with sufficient size (e.g., 350GB):

sudo mount -o remount,size=350G /dev/shm
Then run your parallel BaseSpace ‚Üí S3 transfers using this fast RAM-backed filesystem.

Your benchmarks confirm the RAM disk approach as the optimal solution.

üìå Interpretation:
/dev/shm (RAM) is ~64 times faster than your local EBS disk (/home/ubuntu).

FSx Lustre (/fsx) is ~4 times faster than your local EBS.

Your local disk (/home/ubuntu) is the slowest due to being limited by EBS disk bandwidth and latency.

This demonstrates clearly why avoiding local disk writes and using a RAM-backed filesystem for temporary file storage significantly speeds up your workflow.

üö® Recommendation (clearly confirmed):
Optimal: /dev/shm
Best choice by far; provides huge speed advantages for temporary FASTQ storage.

Acceptable (second-best): /fsx
Use if you need persistent storage. Decent performance, but significantly slower than RAM.

Avoid: Local EBS disk (/home/ubuntu)
Too slow for intensive data workflows involving large files.

‚úÖ Bottom Line:
Your tests confirm that using /dev/shm for your BaseSpace ‚Üí S3 transfers is the fastest and most efficient solution.

ok- i'm on a 192 vcpu box with 756G of ram. i want to do these basespace transfers here
ChatGPT said:
With your powerful 192 vCPU / 756 GB RAM instance, you can run these BaseSpace transfers at a very high parallelism using the RAM-backed filesystem (/dev/shm) approach. Here's exactly how to set it up:

üöÄ Step-by-step optimal setup for your instance:
‚úÖ Step 1: Expand /dev/shm RAM Disk
Set /dev/shm to ~700GB to safely hold temporary files in memory:

sudo mount -o remount,size=700G /dev/shm
df -h /dev/shm
‚úÖ Step 2: Updated Transfer Script (transfer_to_s3.sh)
(Make sure BaseSpace CLI and AWS CLI are already configured and authenticated.)

Create this optimized script:

#!/bin/bash

DATASET_ID=$1
DEST_BUCKET=$2
TMPDIR="/dev/shm/${DATASET_ID}"

echo "üì• [$(date)] Downloading dataset ${DATASET_ID} to ${TMPDIR}"
mkdir -p "${TMPDIR}"

bs download dataset -i "${DATASET_ID}" -o "${TMPDIR}"

echo "üöÄ [$(date)] Uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3"
aws s3 sync "${TMPDIR}" "${DEST_BUCKET}/${DATASET_ID}/" \
    --storage-class STANDARD \
    --no-progress \
    --cli-read-timeout 0 \
    --cli-connect-timeout 0

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ [$(date)] Successfully uploaded ${DATASET_ID} to S3, cleaning up."
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
else
    echo "‚ùå [$(date)] Error uploading ${DATASET_ID} to S3. Check manually!"
fi
Make executable:

chmod +x transfer_to_s3.sh
‚úÖ Step 3: Optimal Parallelism for 192 vCPUs & 756GB RAM
Each dataset ~3GB; with 700GB RAM allocated, you can safely run ~100‚Äì150 parallel transfers at a time.

Recommended conservative setting: start at 96 parallel jobs and scale carefully upward if comfortable:

cat datasets.txt | parallel -j96 ./transfer_to_s3.sh {} s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/NovaSeqX_WHGS_TruSeqPF_HG002-007
Monitor resource usage with:

htop (CPU & RAM usage)

df -h /dev/shm (RAM disk usage)

iftop (network throughput)

If resources remain plentiful, safely increase parallelism (-j128 or even -j150).

üß† Expected Realistic Performance:
Network: Typically your limiting factor (likely 50‚Äì200Gbps). Your instance supports at least 100Gbps, likely 200Gbps, ensuring extremely fast transfers.

Storage (RAM disk): ~17GB/s, not a bottleneck.

Practical:

Transfers of ~500GB of data should complete comfortably within 5‚Äì10 minutes.

üìå Final Checklist Before Starting:
 Set /dev/shm size adequately (700G)

 AWS CLI authenticated

 BaseSpace CLI authenticated

 Transfer script verified executable

 Confirm initial parallelism (-j96 recommended start)

You're now set for maximum-speed, efficient transfers! Let me know if you need any more details or tuning.

each dataset is for a pair of fastqs

ls /dev/shm/ds.1071fb2fd649468b993d593323d57e3b/
NovaSeqX-TSPF-NA24695-Rep3_S18_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  NovaSeqX-TSPF-NA24695-Rep3_S18_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

I'd like to create a single R1 andR2 fastq for each giab sample of these smaller fastqs.  both R1 and R2 must be created from the same order of R1 and R2 small fastqs. So, for every giab sample all will need to be downloaded before transferring the single to s3 (can this be done in a stream?)
ChatGPT said:
Yes‚Äîthis is totally doable, efficient, and can absolutely be done as a streaming operation!

Here's exactly how you'd achieve it, clearly explained and structured for efficiency and correctness.

üß† What you want (clearly):
For each GIAB sample (e.g., NA24695), you have multiple BaseSpace datasets. Each dataset contains a pair of FASTQs:

..._R1.fastq.gz

..._R2.fastq.gz

You want to:

Download all datasets for each GIAB sample into /dev/shm.

Concatenate all R1 files (in the same order) into one large R1 file.

Concatenate all R2 files (in the same order) into one large R2 file.

Stream the result directly to S3 (without intermediate persistent disk storage).

üöÄ Efficient recommended approach:
For each GIAB sample, do the following steps automatically in a clear script:

Download each BaseSpace dataset (fast) ‚Üí RAM (/dev/shm)

Concatenate (cat) FASTQs in RAM

Pipe (|) the result directly to S3 (aws s3 cp -)

This is efficient because:

All operations happen in RAM (ultra-fast)

No persistent disk I/O (high performance)

Streaming upload directly (minimal RAM usage)

‚úÖ Full Automated Example Script
Create a script called concat_upload_giab.sh:

#!/bin/bash

GIAB_SAMPLE=$1
DEST_BUCKET=$2
TMPDIR="/dev/shm/${GIAB_SAMPLE}"
mkdir -p "${TMPDIR}"

# Find and download datasets for this GIAB_SAMPLE:
DATASET_IDS=$(bs list dataset | grep "$GIAB_SAMPLE" | grep fastq | awk '{print $4}')

echo "üì• [$(date)] Downloading all datasets for ${GIAB_SAMPLE} into ${TMPDIR}"

# Download datasets
for DSID in ${DATASET_IDS}; do
    echo "   ‚û°Ô∏è  Downloading dataset: ${DSID}"
    bs download dataset -i "${DSID}" -o "${TMPDIR}/${DSID}"
done

# Confirm all datasets downloaded
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå [$(date)] Error downloading datasets for ${GIAB_SAMPLE}"
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
    exit 1
fi

# Concatenate R1 files in order, stream upload directly to S3
echo "üì§ [$(date)] Streaming R1 concatenation to S3"
find "${TMPDIR}" -name '*_R1_*.fastq.gz' | sort | xargs cat | \
    aws s3 cp - "${DEST_BUCKET}/${GIAB_SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz" \
    --storage-class STANDARD --no-progress

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå [$(date)] Error uploading ${GIAB_SAMPLE}_R1 to S3"
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
    exit 1
fi

# Concatenate R2 files in the exact same order, stream upload to S3
echo "üì§ [$(date)] Streaming R2 concatenation to S3"
find "${TMPDIR}" -name '*_R2_*.fastq.gz' | sort | xargs cat | \
    aws s3 cp - "${DEST_BUCKET}/${GIAB_SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz" \
    --storage-class STANDARD --no-progress

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå [$(date)] Error uploading ${GIAB_SAMPLE}_R2 to S3"
    rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
    exit 1
fi

# Cleanup
echo "üßπ [$(date)] Cleaning up ${TMPDIR}"
rm -rf "${TMPDIR}"
echo "‚úÖ [$(date)] Done for ${GIAB_SAMPLE}"
Make it executable:

chmod +x concat_upload_giab.sh
üö® Usage Example:
Let's say you're uploading to s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/concatenated_fastqs:

./concat_upload_giab.sh NA24695 s3://lsmc-illumina-public-data/concatenated_fastqs
Repeat for each GIAB sample (e.g., NA24695, NA24143, NA24694, etc.).

You can parallelize multiple GIAB samples safely:

echo -e "NA24695\nNA24143\nNA24694\nNA24631\nNA24149\nNA24385\nNA12878" \
 | parallel -j4 ./concat_upload_giab.sh {} s3://your-bucket/path/
Adjust parallelism as desired.

‚ö° Why this is optimal:
No disk bottlenecks (100% RAM)

Direct streaming (minimal memory overhead)

Simple cleanup (RAM space recovered immediately)

You're now set up with a highly efficient, scalable, robust pipeline clearly tailored for your powerful hardware and desired workflow.
