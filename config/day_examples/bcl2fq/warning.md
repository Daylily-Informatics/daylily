# DAY Does Not Build BCL2FQ Samplesheets

You are responsible for generating the appropriate sample sheet for your run.  The example here is for a 2x151 PE lib and is only applicable to thissequencing mode. `read: do not use this as a template, it is for refernce purposes only`.  If you wish to know more about bcl2fq sample sheets, [the specifications may be found here](https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/technotes/sequencing-sheet-format-specifications-technical-note-970-2017-004.pdf).

## Valid Ways To Obtain A Sample Sheet
1) If a miseq run has been created, from the formatted run page, at the mid-top center of the page is a button which will download one (that will need to have the fields continaing SQs stripped to just SQs.
2) From a BCL2FQ job run in an AT, you can use the SampleSheet.tsv directly from there.
