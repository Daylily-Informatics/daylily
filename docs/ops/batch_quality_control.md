# Per-Sample And Among Sample (batch) QC 
Can be generated during processing a batch of samples (additional costs to compute). Tools to run may be configured, by default, daylily runs an abundance of QC tools.
  - Over 300 metrics per-sample are generated by daylily.

## QC Tools Available
Several tools run are redundant.  It is easy to switch them on or off.

### [MultiQC](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC)
  > A tool to aggregate a large number of informatics QC tools output into a single report.

### [Alignstats](https://github.com/jfarek/alignstats)
  > Exhaustive BAM Alignment stats.
  
### [VerifyBAM2](https://github.com/Griffan/VerifyBamID)
  > Human contamination estimation.
  
### Coverage Eveness Estimation
  > A tool which calculates coverage eveness for each chromosome. Intended for use in flagging sample data which may produce questionable SV results.

### [Picard](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard)
  > Another BAM statistic producer.
  
### [mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth)
  > Depth of coverage statistics
  
### [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC)
  > Produces fastq quality metrics.
  
### [Peddy](https://github.com/brentp/peddy)
  > Produces biologic sex predictions and flags mismatches with the given biologic sex. Predicts the sample ethnicity, and produces some other VCF stats.
  
### [Qualimap](http://qualimap.conesalab.org/)
  > A bam stats producer.
    
### [goleft](https://github.com/brentp/goleft)
  > Coverage stats producer.
    
### [bcftools](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/releases/)
  > VCF stats producer.
    
### [samtools](https://github.com/samtools)
  > A bam file stats producer.
  
### Per-Rule Benchmark Runtime Stats
  > aggregates and reports the snakemake runtime performance stats produced per rule.

### Concordance Metrics
  > Concordance metric table for all samples flagged to produce concordance results given a truth vcf and bed file.
